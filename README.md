## Power BI Dashboard Project

## Brief

Welcome to the Power BI Dashboard Project designed and delivered by Santa Fe Team for our valued client Privade Enterprises through our partnership with getINNOtized. This end-to-end business intelligence solution is aimed at leveraging the collected transactional data for the year 2019 to provide valuable insights and recommendations.

## Client Objectives

Our client, who has accumulated transactional data for the year 2019, is seeking answers to specific questions to optimize their business operations:

1. **Revenue Analysis:**
   - How much money did we make this year?

2. **Sales Seasonality:**
   - Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?

3. **Product Performance:**
   - What are our best and worst-selling products?
   - Products with unit prices above $99.99 should be labeled high-level; otherwise, they should be basic level.

4. **Sales Comparison:**
   - How do sales compare to previous months or weeks?

5. **Geographical Analysis:**
   - Which cities are our products delivered to most?

6. **Product Categories:**
   - How do product categories compare in revenue generated and quantities ordered?

7. **Additional Insights:**
   - You are required to show additional details from your findings in your data.

## Dataset Information

Sales data was collected for each month throughout the entire year of 2019. The data for the first half of the year (January to June) was initially collected in Excel and saved as CSV files. Later, management decided to use databases to store their data.

- The first 6 months' data was stored in onedrive.
- The last 6 months of the dataset were stored in a remote database.
